# 3D-shaded-relief-maps-using-Rayshader
Code used to generate 3D shaded-relief biodiversity maps for the "Mira-Mataje" binational basin.

This is a simple R-script to generate 3D shaded-relief maps on the [Rayshader](https://github.com/tylermorganwall/rayshader) package for R. Chek Tyler Morgan Wall's marvelous package at the [Rayshader portal](https://www.rayshader.com/).

The 3D figures will be eventually published as part of a scientific manuscript in the works. I will update this information with the full reference once it gets published with a proper DOI.
